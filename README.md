# SchemAI

SchemAI is a prototype and proof of concept for a tool that transforms data from one form into another. You can take a CSV file and turn it into a JSON, XML, YAML, HTML, and many more. You could even take a sentence and turn it into a dictionary, a list, etc. The possibilities are vast.

## Features

- **Data Transformation**: SchemAI can take data in one form and transform it into another. This includes common data formats like CSV, JSON, XML, YAML, HTML, and many more. You can even transform sentences into dictionaries, lists, etc.

- **Preset Data Schemes**: SchemAI comes with a number of presets for common data schemes. The model gives special attention to these preset types, resulting in more accurate and reliable transformations. You can also supply your own custom data scheme with some concise instructions.

- **Code Generation**: SchemAI automatically generates viable code for parsing and extracting the AI's response. This feature has the potential to create a new kind of experience that we really haven't seen yet.

- **Dynamic Parser**: The dynamically generated parser feature currently builds the Langchain output parser in Python. Plans to integrate JavaScript, PHP, and OpenAI functions are in the works.

## Why SchemAI?

While there have been many solutions to the predictability/parsing problem lately, these responses merely give us a good working space with a solid surface to build on. By building on systems such as Langchain while utilizing the new fine-tuned functions in GPT-4, this project serves as a general proof of concept.

In essence, SchemAI is about saving time, saving brain cells, and saving yourself from the complexities of data transformation and parsing. It's a tool designed to make your life easier, whether you're a developer dealing with various data formats or someone who just wants to understand their data better.

## Future Work

The dynamically generated parser feature currently builds the Langchain output parser in Python. Plans to integrate JavaScript, PHP, and OpenAI functions are in the works. The model will continue to expand and intensify with further learning as time goes on.

## Conclusion

SchemAI is more than a tool. It's a companion in the vast puzzle of data, ready to translate, guide, and adapt. It's about making the world of data a less daunting place to explore, and everyone is invited to join the journey.
